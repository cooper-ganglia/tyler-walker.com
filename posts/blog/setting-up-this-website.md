This site started as a way to centralize things I was already doing:
running services, building small projects, and keeping notes.

I wanted something simple, fast, and entirely under my control.
No CMS, no database, no build pipeline.

## Why static

Static files age well. They break less often and are easy to move.

They also force clarity. What exists is what you ship.

## The stack

Right now the site is intentionally boring:

- Static HTML
- Markdown for content
- Minimal JavaScript
- Self-hosted services behind it

That stack has been more than enough so far.

I have run enough services over the years that hosting them myself stopped
feeling experimental and started feeling normal.

Self hosting gives me three things I care about:

- Control over my data
- Predictable behavior
- Fewer moving parts

## Fewer abstractions

Most modern services hide complexity behind layers of dashboards and accounts.
Running things locally forces me to understand what is actually happening.

That understanding pays dividends when something breaks.

## It scales quietly

I add services when I need them.
Jellyfin, request management, small automation scripts.

No platform decisions.
No migrations.
No lock-in.

It is boring in the best possible way.
